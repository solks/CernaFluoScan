I have tested this on Linux and Windows machines. You must have the Andor's Linux SDK installed.

The actual module is andor.py. There is a small example on how to use it 'simple_example.py'.
There is also another more useful example with a simple text menu in 'camera.py'. Currently 
there is no documentation for this module but if I found that there is reasonable interest 
in this project I shall make one!
